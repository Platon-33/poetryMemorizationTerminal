# poetryMemorizationTerminal
A tool that can be used to memorize any poem from the WCC curriculum as of 2024.
 This is written in C# and is a ongoing project. Things I would like to iplement are:
- a point system that tracks how many stanzas in a row are completed before needing a prompt
- the ability to add new poetry from the app itself, not the base code
